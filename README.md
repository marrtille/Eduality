# Eduality - is a website dedicated in promoting education equality through the use of data visualization.
We aim to raise awareness about the existing gender disparities in education and the impact it has on individuals and communities. By presenting data in a clear and engaging way, Eduality hopes to inspire and encourage action towards promoting education equality for all.

The code for website was written by Mariam Tutayeva in July 2023.
